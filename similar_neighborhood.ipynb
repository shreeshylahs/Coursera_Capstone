    "Often people have to relocate to different cities due to Job change, there is always a confusion on which neighborhood to shift to in a particular city. Varieties of question arises, \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Business Problem:\n",
    "As we can get the neighborhood data of every city, the venues around the neighborhood, the distance between neighborhood and venues along with rating of venues, crime rates data, this project aims to predict the similar neighborhood based on the current neighborhood and also the nearest to the new desired place of work\n",

    "### 1.3 Interest:\n",
    "Almost all the working professional who desire to relocate to the new city for better opportunity to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an instance, Person named \"Adam\" living in \"St. James Town, Downtown Toronto, Canada\" has earned a Job in \"Midtown south, Manhattan, New York\". The proposed model will suggest the neighborhood of Manhattan which is similar to Adam's current neighborhood and also the nearest to his new workplace."
